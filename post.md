Hi everyone! I’m excited to share my submission for the hackathon: KidCreatives AI.

We often talk about AI taking over creative jobs, but I wanted to build something that empowers the next generation instead. KidCreatives AI is an explorative, fun and educational platform that teaches children (ages 7-11) the "language" of AI, or as you might refer to as prompt engineering and AI literacy in general. Instead of just generating images from thin air, the webapp takes a child’s original drawing and uses Gemini Vision 2.5 to "see" it.

Guided by "Sparky" (the webapp’s AI coach), kids answer creative questions to build their own prompts block-by-block. This turns the mysterious "black box" of AI into a transparent "glass box," showing them exactly how their inputs shape the final output. The result is their original composition, reimagined as a professional masterpiece (powered by Nano Banana image generator), boosting their confidence as creators.

Tech Stack:

Built 100% with Kiro CLI (the "Quick Start" workflow was a lifesaver!)

Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for multimodal analysis and generation

React + Vite for the frontend

I’d love for you to check out the demo and let me know what you think! 🚀
