# KidCreatives AI

**Teaching AI Literacy Through Creative Expression**

An educational web application that transforms AI from a "black box" into a "glass box" for children aged 7-10, teaching prompt engineering through interactive art creation.

## 📖 Overview

KidCreatives AI is an educational platform that teaches children how AI systems work by making the prompt engineering process visible and interactive. Instead of just generating art, children learn **how** AI creates by building prompts through a guided 5-phase workflow.

### The Problem We Solve

Children use AI tools daily but don't understand how they work. KidCreatives AI bridges this gap by:
- Making AI decision-making transparent ("glass box" vs "black box")
- Teaching prompt engineering through creative expression
- Providing tangible learning artifacts (certificates, prompt cards)
- Building AI literacy skills for the next generation

### Who It's For

- **Primary**: Children aged 7-10 learning AI literacy
- **Secondary**: Parents and educators seeking quality educational screen time
- **Use Cases**: Classroom AI education, home learning, creative portfolio building
